The first scene involves a point cloud of a horse and a man being morphed to the music, with additional effects like glow + noise happening to the sound. The second clip is a tiled arrangement of two clips (a horse running and kids playing baseball) being arranged to a UV map that is changing to music. The concept involved abstracting what the words pony and boy stood for…"

The video interplays between a memory of a childhood trip and a ride I am currently taking on the M - train. The exploration of postmemory and disintegration/dissolution of personal memory are themes that I have started to integrate more with my work recently. This assignment was an opportunity to keep working on overlaying, contrasting and fragmenting my memories."

          "text": "I worked towards achieving a fluid dissipation between both footages, as that is how memory feels on a personal level. The ephemerality of this balance was shaped by the music, in both the sonic data it provided and the soundscape it presented. I managed to achieve this coming in and out of memory by using the audio-reactive noise as an alpha matte. However, at the time of composition of both clips, their interplay didn’t feel as smooth as I had wanted. Changing the blend mode to add on accident was a welcome surprise as it created halations and light effects in the footage. I’d like to keep working on making the shifts between the two realities appear more sub-conscious and for them to be more dream-like and fluid in their visual nature."
