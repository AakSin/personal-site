          "text": "The visuals involve a character falling from the sky and landing underwater. While underwater, the character is surrounded by oceanic rocks and flora. An infinite expansive ocean is an image I keep coming back to, as it helps me convey feelings of isolation, absence, and disorientation. This feeling/vision of being underwater further adds another dimension of distance, with a whole alien world and no words to communicate with. Using the fast blurred motion and low angle of the camera I aimed to add to the disorientation."

          "text": "Knowing I wanted to create an underwater scene, I started looking for ways to do it. I came across a blueprint (linked in credits) that generates beautiful oceans effortlessly. Using this as a stepping point, I started creating massive monolithic stone landscapes using Quixel Bridge and then added vibrant flora to add to the alienness of the scene. Hardware issues kept bogging me down and I wasn’t able to do everything I had set out to do. I was aiming to add oceanic alien fauna as well and then some more ethereal lighting and underwater fog. Given more time, I would aim to create ephemeral ruins in the ocean too."

Through this scene, I conceived three fictional creatures by playing at their root nouns and placed them in a jungle setting. The creatures are Sea Dog ( German word for seal: Seehund), Earth Pig (aardvark: Erdferkel), and Ice Bear (Polar Bear: Eisbär). They are created by replacing the materials of these animal models with the materials of these elements."

          "text": "The hardest part of this assignment for me was the composition and compositing of the scene. Getting the lighting right for a jungle scene and making the jungle scene look right was a tricky challenge. I played around with the landscape tool, auto landscape material, foliage tool, and tree packs but still, the scene looked too unnatural to me. I think playing with the exponential fog and post-process volume and giving it a warmer tone helped bring it closer to the vision in my head. I’d still like to learn how to get better at environmental lighting and create more natural-looking scenes."
