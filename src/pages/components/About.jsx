          Aakarsh Singh (he/they) is a multi-disciplinary new media artist
          originally from India but now settled in the United Arab Emirates.

        <p className="pt-4">
          Aakarsh grew up interested in both technology and the arts, which led
          them to pursue a major that would allow them to combine these
          initially divulging interests. With their studies in Interactive
          Media, Aakarsh works between virtual reality, augmented reality,
          artificial intelligence, sound-light installations, and interconnected
          multimedia websites. They aim to explore ideas of postcolonial and
          queer identities by pushing at the boundaries of these mediums.

          In their free time they play the guitar, make music, and create
          digital art.
